This repository conatins work on two assessments for the Research Methods module - a *Literature Review* and a *Research Presentation*, both on an area of active research. I have chosen to research 5G, the fifth generation of communications technology.

## What is 5G?
No real definition yet (still setting out standards, experts don't even have a proper definition/depends on who you ask) - simply put, a faster and more efficient version of 4G, with different technologies behind it. 5 main technologies - Millimetre Waves, Small Cell, Massive MIMO, Beamforming, and Full Duplex.
