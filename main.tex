\section{Introduction}
In recent years, particularly the last decade, the mobile telecommunications industry has enjoyed rapid growth and countless advancements in its technology. From the introduction of first generation wireless cellular technology (1G) in the 1980s, right up to the fourth generation (4G) available in most countries around the world today, we have seen exponential improvement in services. Since the first mobile phone call was made in 1973, the way we share information and communicate with one another has changed dramatically. With the introduction of social media in particular, we are now generating massive amounts of data and require more robust networks to handle such data. It was estimated in\cite{whatwill5gbe}, that the amount of IP data handled by wireless networks would increase from around 3 exabytes in 2010, to 190 exabytes in 2018. This level of data, coupled with an estimated 20 billion devices connected to the internet in 2017\cite{ihsmarkit} and that number set to increase constantly, means our networks are facing a worldwide shortage in bandwidth.

%\subsection{Predecessors}
%Might leave section out.
%https://www.edn.com/electronics-blogs/edn-moments/4411258/1st-mobile-phone-call-is-made--April-3--1973
%1G - the first phones, being able to make a phone call.\\
%2G - slightly smaller devices, could send text messages.\\
%3G - first smartphones, could handle basic internet/webpages etc.\\
%4G - advanced smartphones, very fast - personal tests on phone peak at 70mbps download speed, average at around 15mbps.\\
%\subsection{More Detail on Current/4G Technology?}
\subsection{What is 5G?}



\section{Proposed Technologies}
Talk about technologies etc. Might get rid of subsections or reduce them down (MMWaves \& Small Cell can be tied together, same with MIMO \& Beamforming).
\subsection{Millimetre Waves}
\subsection{Small Cell Networks}
\subsection{MIMO: Multiple Input Multiple Output}
\subsection{Beamforming}
\subsection{Full Duplex}

\section{When Will 5G Arrive? / Future of 5G}
Cost, infrastructure etc. Might change to subsection of some other bigger section including this and companies/investment, maybe future of 5G.
\subsection{Companies/Investment/Main Contributors?}

\subsection{Problems / Criticisms Section?}
